# Books and Movies

Books and Movies is a website for recording observations and comments on, well, books and movies that I've seen recently.

The prompt for it was all the great films that I've been watching since I subscribed to the [Criterion Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/browse). Although I'm an [English professor](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/) at the [University of Lethbridge](https://uleth.ca/), this is not intended as a professional site. It is more notes and comments.
